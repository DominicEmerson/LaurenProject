This is a barebones working containers to get you started. Django and Postgre containers talking to each. You will need to re-add your templates etc you've been working on to fill out the database.

Remember as you add stuff - create a branch away from main to do your new work. Test it, and if it works you can fold into main. No one should ever push straight to main. Brnaches should only be open
long enough to do that task and not be allowed to diverge too far from the main as it's being updated.

Good guide
